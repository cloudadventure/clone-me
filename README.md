## Cloud Adventure: Race to Cloud Castle
*This story is in progress. To start from the beginning, visit adventure.acloud.guru.*

As you back away from the cave, you catch sight of some deadly software bugs crawling just inside the entrance.  It's a good thing you didn't go in there!

After a few more hours of walking, your legs are tired and you long for a rest. 

You are delighted to find a woodcutter's hut beside the path, and even more so by the PEARL you find nearby. You knock on the door and meet the woodcutter, a friendly chap named Ryan with an accent you can't quite place.

Over a cup of hot grog, you tell him about your woes in reaching Cloud Castle.

"Believe me, mate, I understand," he says. "The castles do not yield their secrets easily. The good news is, there's more than one castle to choose from."

"Are you talking about ... multicloud?" you whisper.

Ryan gestures out the window. Through a gap in the trees you see two massive fortresses. "Too right, mate."

If you set your course for the castle on the left, spin up the Docker Hub image [cloudadventure/gke_image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudadventure/gke_image) on Google Compute Engine or GKE, then run the associated web app.

If you choose to try your luck at the castle on the right, spin up the Docker Hub image [cloudadventure/aks_image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cloudadventure/aks_image) on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, then run the associated web app.

*Remember: if you have an A Cloud Guru account, you can get a clean AWS, Azure, or GCP sandbox account in just a couple of seconds using Cloud Playground.*
